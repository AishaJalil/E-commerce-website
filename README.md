## 📄 Project Overview

This project is a hands-on frontend assignment designed as part of my internship at a tech-focused e-commerce startup. The goal is to build a **realistic product display and cart experience** similar to platforms like **Amazon** or **Flipkart**, with a focus on interactivity, responsiveness, and user-friendly design.

## 🎯 Objectives

* ✅ Build a **responsive product detail page**.
* ✅ Implement **image zoom on hover** for better viewing.
* ✅ Allow **variant selection** (e.g., color, size).
* ✅ Dynamically update the **product image and price** based on the selected variant.
* ✅ Add a **quantity selector** and calculate total price in real-time.
* ✅ Implement an **"Add to Cart"** feature that updates a live cart preview.
* ✅ Use **localStorage** to persist cart data across pages and sessions.
